## 0.strcat 
a function that concatenates two strings.

- This function appends the `src` string to the `dest` string, overwriting the terminating null byte (`\0`) at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte
- Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

## 1. strncat
a function that concatenates two strings.

- The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
- Return a pointer to the resulting string des
